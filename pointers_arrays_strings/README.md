Prototype: void reset_to_98(int *n);
1-swap.c Write a function that swaps the values of two integers.
Prototype: void swap_int(int *a, int *b);
2-strlen.c Write a function that returns the length of a string.
Prototype: int _strlen(char *s);
FYI: The standard library provides a similar function: strlen. Run man strlen to learn more.
3-puts.c Write a function that prints a string, followed by a new line, to stdout.
Prototype: void _puts(char *str);
FYI: The standard library provides a similar function: puts. Run man puts to learn more.
4-print_rev.c Write a function that prints a string, in reverse, followed by a new line.
Prototype: void print_rev(char *s);
5-rev_string.c Write a function that reverses a string.
Prototype: void rev_string(char *s);
6-puts2.c Write a function that prints every other character of a string, starting with the first character, followed by a new line.
Prototype: void puts2(char *str);
7-puts_half.c Write a function that prints half of a string, followed by a new line.
Prototype: void puts_half(char *str);
The function should print the second half of the string
If the number of characters is odd, the function should print the last n characters of the string, where n = (length_of_the_string - 1) / 2
8-print_array.c Write a function that prints n elements of an array of integers, followed by a new line.
Prototype: void print_array(int *a, int n);
where n is the number of elements of the array to be printed
Numbers must be separated by comma, followed by a space
The numbers should be displayed in the same order as they are stored in the array
You are allowed to use printf
9-strcpy.c Prototype: char *_strcpy(char *dest, char *src);
Write a function that copies the string pointed to by src, including the terminating null byte (\0), to the buffer pointed to by dest.
Return value: the pointer to dest
FYI: The standard library provides a similar function: strcpy. Run man strcpy to learn more.


0-strcat.c Write a function that concatenates two strings.
Prototype: char *_strcat(char *dest, char *src);
This function appends the src string to the dest string, overwriting the terminating null byte (\0) at the end of dest, and then adds a terminating null byte
Returns a pointer to the resulting string dest
FYI: The standard library provides a similar function: strcat. Run man strcat to learn more.
1-strncat.c Write a function that concatenates two strings.
Prototype: char *_strncat(char *dest, char *src, int n);
The _strncat function is similar to the _strcat function, except that
it will use at most n bytes from src; and
src does not need to be null-terminated if it contains n or more bytes
Return a pointer to the resulting string dest
FYI: The standard library provides a similar function: strncat. Run man strncat to learn more.
2-strncpy.c Write a function that copies a string.
Prototype: char *_strncpy(char *dest, char *src, int n);
Your function should work exactly like strncpy
FYI: The standard library provides a similar function: strncpy. Run man strncpy to learn more.
3-strcmp.c Write a function that compares two strings.
Prototype: int _strcmp(char *s1, char *s2);
Your function should work exactly like strcmp
FYI: The standard library provides a similar function: strcmp. Run man strcmp to learn more.
4-rev_array.c Write a function that reverses the content of an array of integers.
Prototype: void reverse_array(int *a, int n);
Where n is the number of elements of the array
5-string_toupper.c Write a function that changes all lowercase letters of a string to uppercase.
Prototype: char *string_toupper(char *);
 6-cap_string.c Write a function that capitalizes all words of a string.
 Prototype: char *cap_string(char *);
 Separators of words: space, tabulation, new line, ,, ;, ., !, ?, ", (, ), {, and }
 7-leet.c Write a function that encodes a string into 1337.
 Letters a and A should be replaced by 4
 Letters e and E should be replaced by 3
 Letters o and O should be replaced by 0
 Letters t and T should be replaced by 7
 Letters l and L should be replaced by 1
 Prototype: char *leet(char *);
 You can only use one if in your code
 You can only use two loops in your code
 You are not allowed to use switch
 You are not allowed to use any ternary operation
